#### Is this project named Sagan... as in *Carl Sagan?*

Yeah, [that guy][sagan]. He was a pretty inspiring [explainer of things][cosmos], and we named this project after him in the hope that it might be effective in explaining many of the wonderful things Spring has to offer. We hope you enjoy and get value out of it, and that our little project might live up in some small way to its very big namesake.
