### Major work areas

The Sagan development team is always monitoring incoming issues, but the following are the major areas that we're focused on in the near future. Generally, each are associated with a [milestone](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues/milestones).


#### Release Sagan in the open

_milestone:_ [open-source](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues?milestone=3)

_UPDATE, March 27th:_ Done! Read all about it in the [announcement blog post](TODO).


#### Weekly blog series (next 4-5 weeks)

_milestone:_ [blog-series](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues?milestone=4)

As mentioned in the blog post above, @bclozel, @cbeams and perhaps additional team members will put together weekly blogs and screencasts exploring various aspects of the Sagan application. Subscribe to the [engineering](http://spring.io/blog/category/engineering.atom) category of the blog to stay tuned. 


#### Continued documentation and refactoring work

_milestone:_ [docs](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues?milestone=5)

As a reference app, it's important to us that Sagan provides users with the ability to take a "self-guided tour" of its contents, and to find clean, modern, idiomatic use of Java and Spring everywhere they go. The deveolopment team is happy with the application as a whole (we wouldn't have released it in the open otherwise!), but there is definitely room for continued improvement. The two main areas are ensuring that there is at least class-level Javadoc for every component ([#327](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues/327)) and README files throughout all key directories in the application ([#328](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues/328))--the latter makes for a great experience when browsing the repo via GitHub!. Stay tuned to the repository for those changes, as we'll be working on them actively over the coming days.


#### Make use of JDK8 language features

_milestone:_ [jdk8](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues?milestone=6)

We're really excited about this one. Sagan runs well on JDK8 already, but in this milestone, we'll make aggressive use of the new language features in JDK8 to make Sagan a showcase for what's possible when you combine the modern Spring with modern Java. It'll no doubt be a big learning experience for everyone involved. Subscribe to ([#181](https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/issues/181)) for updates.
