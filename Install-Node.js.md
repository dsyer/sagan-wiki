### Goal

Install Node.js 0.10 (or better) in order to run the `sagan-client` build.

### Prerequisites

_None_

### Steps

1. Go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and click "Install"
2. Verify that the installation was successful:
```
$ node --version
v0.10.26
```

_Note:_ If using Windows, verify that a `%APPDATA%\npm` folder has been created (or create it!), otherwise you may experience [this npm issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5905).

### Next steps

Return to [[set up environment]].
