> _**Note:** Sagan uses the [Gradle](http://gradle.org) build system, and thanks to the [Gradle wrapper](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html), there's nothing you need to install. Running the `./gradlew` script as above (or `gradlew.bat` on Windows) will fetch and use the correct Gradle binaries if you don't already have them installed on your system._
    
> _**Tip:** Check out the [`find-gradle`](https://github.com/cbeams/shell-scripts/blob/master/find-gradle) convenience script if you'd like to avoid relative pathing to the `gradlew` script._
    
> _**Tip:** if you wish to skip longer-running integration tests, run the above with `-x integTest`. See also Gradle's documentation on [excluding tasks](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/tutorial_gradle_command_line.html#sec:excluding_tasks_from_the_command_line)._
