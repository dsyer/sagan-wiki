#### Sagan? As in *Carl Sagan?*

Yeah, [that guy][sagan]. He was a pretty inspiring [explainer of things][cosmos], and we named this project after him with the goal of explaining what modern-day Spring has to offer in the context of building a real-world web app. We hope you enjoy and get value out of it, and that in some small way the project might live up to its namesake.
